# MYT1L Data Analysis with BGR Data

For questions on this code and analysis, please contact the corresponding author on the publication. Manuscript and corresponding author will be added here after publication acceptance.

## Repository Data

### MYT1L_Figure.ipynb

Python notebook containing the code to generate Figures 2-6 from the manuscript, and the final supplementary table. Running all cells will generate and save the resulting figures and table in the `MYT1L_paper_figures` folder. All packages utilized are standard for python data analysis. The code is not replicable without access to BGR Data on [CIELO](https://cielo.wustl.edu/#) and REDCap.

### Python_Functions

Folder containing python scripts containing functions that are imported and used in `MYT1L_Figure.ipynb`. These functions deal with the data downloads directly from CIELO and REDCap, cleaning up this data for subsequent analysis. 

### MYT1L_paper_figures

Folder containing the scalable vector graphics format for Figures 2-6 of the manuscript, and the supplementary table.
